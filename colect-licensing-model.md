The TheColect has various subscription-based licenses that can be assigned and re-assigned very flexible to different users within your company.

## Colect Enterprise Edition

In order to use the Colect Platform at least one Colect Enterprise Edition license is required. This license is a **named-user subscription license** and an active license is required for each administrator, salesperson, agent or distributor that is registered with your company. 
 * Users with a Colect Enterprise Edition license can use both the App and web-based environments and present and manage their collections from either tool.
 * Users can manage and place orders for multiple customers.
 * The license allows for an unlimited number of items, collections, images or customers to be used in the system.

## Colect Modules

On top of the Colect Enterprise Edition licenses, a number of modules are available.

 * The Colect B2B Web Edition module allows users to have web-based access to your collections and present your collection. The most common use case for this is to allow your retailer customers access to a customized self-service portal. A Colect B2B Web Edition license is needed for each registered hostname (FQDN). This license includes access for an unlimited number of retail users. Each retail user is only allowed to view the collection and place orders for himself (not on behalf of multiple customers/account numbers). 
 * The Colect B2B Returns Module license can be added on top of the Colect B2B Web Edition license. This module allows your retail customers to place return orders. A returns module license is required for each Colect B2B Webstore license
 * The Colect Customer Analytics module allows users to analyze historical sales numbers of each customer. This module is licensed per named-user.
 * The Colect Budgetting Module allows users to view and update budgets send from your ERP backoffice system. This module is licensed per named-user.
